# ðŸ“¦ Business Data Warehouse (From Raw CSV to Gold Layer)

## ðŸ“– Project Description  
**Business Data Warehouse (From Raw CSV to Gold Layer)** is an end-to-end data engineering project that demonstrates how raw business data can be transformed into valuable insights.  

The project integrates **CRM and ERP datasets** stored as CSV files, processes them through a structured **ETL pipeline (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold)**, and delivers a clean, production-ready **Data Warehouse** that can be directly consumed by BI tools such as **Power BI** or **Tableau**.  

This project is designed as a **blueprint for companies and clients** who want to modernize their data infrastructure and unlock actionable insights from raw data.
